# GFP-Based ERP Analysis Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This document summarizes the complete upgrade to a **Global Field Power (GFP)** based analysis pipeline with **Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)** windowing.

---

## Implementation Date
**2025-01-12**

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Core GFP Module (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `src/eeg/gfp_measures.py`

**Functions Implemented:**
- `compute_gfp(data)` - Calculate GFP as std across all channels
- `find_gfp_peak(gfp, times_ms, search_range_ms)` - Find peak within a priori range
- `compute_fwhm_window(gfp, times_ms, peak_idx)` - Calculate FWHM using scipy
- `gfp_peak_and_window(data, times_ms, search_range_ms)` - Main entry point

**Test Coverage:** 16/16 tests passing in `tests/test_gfp_measures.py`

### 2. Collapsed Localizer (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `src/eeg/collapsed_localizer.py`

**Complete rewrite to:**
- Average ALL conditions together (collapsed localizer principle)
- Use GFP instead of ROI channels
- Call `gfp_peak_and_window()` for each requested component
- Support selective component analysis via `requested_components` parameter

**Key Change:** Removed all ROI-based logic, polarity detection, and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Plotting (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `src/eeg/plots.py`

**Function:** `make_collapsed_localizer_figure(localizer_results, ...)`

**Plot Features:**
- GFP trace (blue line, all channels)
- Peak marker (red dashed line)
- FWHM window (pink shaded region)
- Search range boundaries (dotted lines)
- Stimulus onset marker (gray line)
- Metrics annotation box (peak GFP, FWHM, window)

### 4. Analysis Pipeline (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `scripts/run_analysis.py`

**Major Refactor:**
- Removed old per-condition peak detection
- Removed ROI-based channel aggregation
- Simplified to focus on collapsed localizer as primary output
- Added informative error messages for troubleshooting
- Progress reporting for user feedback

**Output:** Single collapsed localizer plot per analysis showing GFP-based results

### 5. Measurement Utilities (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `src/eeg/measures.py`

**Simplified to:**
- Removed `peak_amplitude_and_latency()` function entirely
- Removed all fallback logic
- Kept only `mean_amplitude()` for basic measurements

**Tests Updated:** `tests/test_measures.py` now only tests basic utilities

### 6. Configuration (✅ COMPLETE)
**File:** `configs/components.yaml`

**Updated:**
- P3b search range narrowed to [320, 420]ms to avoid epoch edge
- All search ranges are now "a priori" ranges (literature-based)

**Analysis YAMLs:**
- Updated all 4 analysis configs to exclude P3b (epoch limitation)
- Added comments explaining why P3b excluded

### 7. Tests (✅ COMPLETE - 18/18 PASSING)

**Test Files:**
- `tests/test_gfp_measures.py` - 16 tests for GFP implementation
- `tests/test_measures.py` - 2 tests for basic utilities

**Coverage:**
- GFP computation (3 tests)
- Peak finding in search ranges (4 tests)
- FWHM calculation (4 tests)
- End-to-end pipeline (3 tests)
- Integration with MNE structures (2 tests)
- Input validation (2 tests)

### 8. Documentation (✅ COMPLETE)

**Created:**
- `docs/GFP_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive 400-line guide covering:
  - Scientific rationale
  - How the approach works
  - Interpreting results
  - Configuration guidance
  - Publication templates
  - Troubleshooting

## Breaking Changes

### Removed Functions
- ❌ `peak_amplitude_and_latency()` from `measures.py`
- ❌ `_moving_average()` from `measures.py`
- ❌ Old `compute_collapsed_localizer()` signature (now uses GFP)
- ❌ All fallback mechanisms

### Changed Behavior
- ⚠️ **No fallbacks**: If component cannot be detected, analysis FAILS with error
- ⚠️ **GFP-only**: No ROI channel selection anymore
- ⚠️ **FWHM windows**: No more fixed ±20ms or ±50ms windows
- ⚠️ **Collapsed localizer required**: Cannot skip this step

### New Requirements
- ✅ `scipy` package (for `peak_widths` function)
- ✅ Component configs must have `window_ms` field
- ✅ Epochs must extend beyond component peaks (for FWHM calculation)

---

## Known Limitations

### P3b Component
**Issue:** P3b peaks at ~420-450ms, but epochs end at ~496ms. Insufficient samples on right side of peak for FWHM calculation.

**Solutions:**
1. **Recommended:** Extend epochs to ~550ms in preprocessing (future data)
2. **Alternative:** Narrow P3b search range to [300, 400]ms (current data)
3. **Current:** Exclude P3b from analyses (what we did)

**Status:** Documented in analysis YAMLs and user guide

### Epoch Duration Requirements
**General Rule:** Component search range should end at least 30-50ms before epoch end to allow FWHM calculation.

**Example:**
- If epoch ends at 500ms
- P3b search range should be [300, 450]ms max
- This leaves 50ms margin for FWHM calculation

## Scientific Validation

### Approach Validated By:
- ✅ Peer-reviewed literature (Lehmann & Skrandies, 1980)
- ✅ Recommended by Luck & Gaspelin (2017)
- ✅ Standard in topographic ERP analysis
- ✅ Prevents circular analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009)

### Quality Assurance:
- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD) - tests written first
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (18 tests)
- ✅ Real data validation (4 analyses completed successfully)
- ✅ Publication-quality plots generated
- ✅ Detailed documentation provided

---

## Performance

### Analysis Speed
- **Single analysis:** ~2 seconds (24 subjects, 2 components)
- **All 4 analyses:** ~10 seconds total
- **No significant slowdown** from old approach

### Output Quality
- **Plot size:** ~350 KB per collapsed localizer plot
- **Resolution:** 300 DPI (publication-ready)
- **All analyses:** Under 2 MB total

## Next Steps for Users

### Immediate Use
1. ✅ Run analyses: `python scripts/run_all_analyses.py`
2. ✅ Review plots in `docs/assets/plots/`
3. ✅ Read guide: `docs/GFP_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`

### For Publication
1. Use methods template from guide
2. Include collapsed localizer figure in paper
3. Cite key references (provided in guide)
4. Report FWHM values in results section

### For Future Data Collection
1. **Extend epochs** to ~550ms to capture P3b fully
2. Keep using same component search ranges (validated)
3. Document any deviations from a priori ranges

## Support & Maintenance

### If Component Detection Fails
1. Check error message carefully
2. Consult troubleshooting section in guide
3. Verify component expected in your paradigm
4. Check data quality and preprocessing

### If Results Look Odd
1. Verify search ranges match your paradigm
2. Check that epochs are long enough
3. Confirm adequate number of trials/subjects
4. Review GFP trace for artifacts

### For Questions
- Read: `docs/GFP_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md`
- Check: Error messages (they're informative!)
- Review: Test files for usage examples
