## 1. Analysis Overview

**Total Measurements:** 192
**Number of Subjects:** 24
**Number of Conditions:** 2

**Components Analyzed:** Fz, N1, P1, P3b
**Dependent Variables:** Latency (Peak), Amplitude (Peak)

### 1.1 Measurement Methodology

- **Component Detection:** collapsed_localizer_fwhm
- **Latency Measure:** Peak latency within FWHM window
- **Amplitude Measure:** Peak amplitude within FWHM window
- **Baseline Period:** [-100, 0] ms

### 1.2 Quality Control Filters

- **Minimum SNR:** ≥ None
- **Missing Data:** Excluded listwise for ANOVA/pairwise

### 1.3 Missing Data Policy

ANOVA and pairwise tests were run on complete cases. Subject-condition combinations with missing latency values or below-threshold SNR were excluded listwise. Linear mixed-effects models retained all subjects with valid measurements to optimally handle missing data.

## 6. Methods Summary (for Publication)

### ERP Measurement

ERP components were measured using a collapsed localizer approach, where component peaks were identified from the grand average of all conditions combined to avoid circular analysis (Luck & Gaspelin, 2017). Measurement windows were defined as the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) around each peak. Component latency was quantified using the 50% fractional area latency (FAL), which represents the time point at which the cumulative area under the curve reaches 50% of its total value within the measurement window. This metric provides a robust estimate of component timing with lower measurement error than peak latency (Kiesel et al., 2008). Mean amplitude was computed as the average voltage within the FWHM window across predefined regions of interest (ROI).

### Statistical Analysis

Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) with random intercepts for subjects were used as the primary analysis, as they optimally handle missing data via maximum likelihood estimation (Baayen et al., 2008). 
For comparison with traditional approaches, repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise t-tests were also performed on complete cases; however, power was substantially reduced by listwise deletion. Therefore, LMM results are emphasized in interpretation.

Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's *d* for pairwise comparisons and generalized eta-squared (η²_G) for ANOVA.
