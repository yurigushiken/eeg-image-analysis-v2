## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [78.0, 117.9] ms (width: 39.9 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [135.6, 207.6] ms (width: 72.0 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 464 ms, FWHM window [452.6, 474.8] ms (width: 22.2 ms)
