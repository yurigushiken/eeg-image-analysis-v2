## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 100 ms, FWHM window [81.9, 113.9] ms (width: 31.9 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [137.4, 206.6] ms (width: 69.2 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 464 ms, FWHM window [442.5, 539.7] ms (width: 97.3 ms)
