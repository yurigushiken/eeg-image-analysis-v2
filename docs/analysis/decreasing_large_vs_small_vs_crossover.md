## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 112 ms, FWHM window [96.8, 127.0] ms (width: 30.2 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [145.8, 209.3] ms (width: 63.5 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [427.9, 540.3] ms (width: 112.3 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [91.4, 121.6] ms (width: 30.2 ms)
