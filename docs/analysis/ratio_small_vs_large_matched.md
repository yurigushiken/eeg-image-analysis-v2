## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [89.2, 120.2] ms (width: 31.1 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [137.1, 211.5] ms (width: 74.4 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 468 ms, FWHM window [427.3, 533.8] ms (width: 106.5 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [88.8, 118.4] ms (width: 29.6 ms)
