## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 96 ms, FWHM window [78.0, 110.2] ms (width: 32.2 ms)
- N1: Peak at 164 ms, FWHM window [134.8, 209.2] ms (width: 74.4 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [418.8, 533.3] ms (width: 114.5 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 100 ms, FWHM window [83.9, 110.9] ms (width: 27.0 ms)
