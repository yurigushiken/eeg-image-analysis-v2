## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 144 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [93.0, 122.4] ms (width: 29.4 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [143.5, 205.7] ms (width: 62.2 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 456 ms, FWHM window [436.6, 482.8] ms (width: 46.2 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [92.0, 120.1] ms (width: 28.1 ms)
