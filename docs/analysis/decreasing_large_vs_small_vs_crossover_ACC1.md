## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 116 ms, FWHM window [98.5, 127.8] ms (width: 29.3 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [145.6, 211.0] ms (width: 65.3 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [432.5, 542.9] ms (width: 110.5 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [92.1, 121.6] ms (width: 29.5 ms)
