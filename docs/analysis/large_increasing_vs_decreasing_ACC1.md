## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [84.5, 116.9] ms (width: 32.4 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [138.0, 206.9] ms (width: 68.9 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 520 ms, FWHM window [451.3, 548.6] ms (width: 97.4 ms)
