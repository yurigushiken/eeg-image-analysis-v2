## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 38 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [94.9, 116.5] ms (width: 21.6 ms)
- N1: Peak at 168 ms, FWHM window [136.9, 205.2] ms (width: 68.3 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [445.1, 552.9] ms (width: 107.8 ms)
