## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [80.1, 119.4] ms (width: 39.3 ms)
- N1: Peak at 168 ms, FWHM window [136.7, 208.0] ms (width: 71.3 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 464 ms, FWHM window [453.8, 473.1] ms (width: 19.3 ms)
