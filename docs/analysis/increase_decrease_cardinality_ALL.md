## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [91.9, 119.4] ms (width: 27.5 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [142.3, 206.3] ms (width: 64.0 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 468 ms, FWHM window [416.4, 531.1] ms (width: 114.7 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 104 ms, FWHM window [89.8, 117.2] ms (width: 27.5 ms)
