## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 54 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [98.1, 116.9] ms (width: 18.8 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [156.9, 211.1] ms (width: 54.3 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 572 ms, FWHM window [554.9, 589.5] ms (width: 34.6 ms)
