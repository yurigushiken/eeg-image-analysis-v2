## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 116 ms, FWHM window [87.2, 130.4] ms (width: 43.2 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [140.9, 214.9] ms (width: 74.0 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 464 ms, FWHM window [447.8, 485.3] ms (width: 37.5 ms)
