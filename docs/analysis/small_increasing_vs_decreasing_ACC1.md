## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [100.5, 117.7] ms (width: 17.2 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [156.6, 212.2] ms (width: 55.6 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 568 ms, FWHM window [556.6, 586.1] ms (width: 29.4 ms)
