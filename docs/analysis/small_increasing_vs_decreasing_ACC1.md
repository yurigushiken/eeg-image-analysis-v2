## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 116 ms, FWHM window [94.5, 127.3] ms (width: 32.7 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [141.2, 215.4] ms (width: 74.2 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [419.3, 533.5] ms (width: 114.2 ms)
