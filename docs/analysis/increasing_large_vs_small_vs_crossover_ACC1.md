## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b, Fz
- P1: Peak at 96 ms, FWHM window [76.7, 110.4] ms (width: 33.8 ms)
- N1: Peak at 164 ms, FWHM window [134.6, 209.5] ms (width: 74.9 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 476 ms, FWHM window [424.0, 536.6] ms (width: 112.5 ms)
- Fz: Peak at 100 ms, FWHM window [82.9, 111.4] ms (width: 28.4 ms)
