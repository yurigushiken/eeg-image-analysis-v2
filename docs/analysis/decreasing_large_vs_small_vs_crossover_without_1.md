## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 72 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 112 ms, FWHM window [98.2, 120.5] ms (width: 22.4 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [140.3, 212.6] ms (width: 72.3 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [427.3, 541.2] ms (width: 114.0 ms)
