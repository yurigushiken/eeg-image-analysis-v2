## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 116 ms, FWHM window [94.9, 127.7] ms (width: 32.8 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [141.4, 214.5] ms (width: 73.1 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 472 ms, FWHM window [419.8, 534.8] ms (width: 115.0 ms)
