## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 108 ms, FWHM window [99.7, 116.8] ms (width: 17.1 ms)
- N1: Peak at 176 ms, FWHM window [156.6, 211.6] ms (width: 55.0 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 568 ms, FWHM window [556.8, 584.0] ms (width: 27.2 ms)
