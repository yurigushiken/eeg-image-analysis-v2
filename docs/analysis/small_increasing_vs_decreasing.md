## Notes

- GFP-based collapsed localizer analysis with 48 subject-condition combinations.
- Components analyzed: P1, N1, P3b
- P1: Peak at 116 ms, FWHM window [92.0, 129.5] ms (width: 37.5 ms)
- N1: Peak at 172 ms, FWHM window [141.2, 214.1] ms (width: 72.9 ms)
- P3b: Peak at 464 ms, FWHM window [446.2, 486.4] ms (width: 40.2 ms)
