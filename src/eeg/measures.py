    Calculate fractional area latency within a time window.

    Finds the time point where the cumulative area under the curve reaches
    a specified fraction of the total area. This provides a robust measure
    of component timing that is less sensitive to noise than peak latency.

    The 50% fractional area latency (default) represents the temporal midpoint
    of a component and is more reliable than peak latency, especially for noisy
    data or components with variable morphology across conditions.

    NOTE: This pipeline uses fraction=0.5 throughout. This parameter is
    documented in the output JSON files (collapsed_localizer_results.json
    and statistical_summary.json) for scientific transparency.

    Args:
        signal: 1D array of EEG data (e.g., ROI-averaged, in microvolts)
        times_ms: 1D array of time points in milliseconds
        window_ms: (start, end) tuple defining window in ms
        fraction: Target fraction of area (default 0.5 for midpoint)
                 Use 0.2 for onset, 0.8 for offset estimation
        polarity: 'positive', 'negative', or 'auto' (infer from mean signal)
                 Determines how to handle signed area computation

    Returns:
        Latency in milliseconds where cumulative area reaches the target fraction

    Raises:
        ValueError: If window has no samples, fraction is invalid, or area
                   computation fails
